This project delivers a powerful yet lightweight Chrome extension designed specifically for LinkedIn Sales Navigator users. It automatically extracts accurate prospect data—including real LinkedIn profile URLs (not Sales Navigator redirects), first name, last name, job title, company name, and company domain. Users can collect leads while scrolling or choose manual one-click capture.

The extension features custom list management, allowing leads to be organized into different groups inside the popup dashboard. When ready, users can send all contacts in a selected list directly to their backend through a single API request. The backend on your domain stores each submission as a structured JSON file, making the system simple, fast, and database-free.

This solution streamlines lead generation, enhances workflow efficiency, and provides a secure, private, and customizable data-capture pipeline—perfect for cold outreach, CRM import, and sales campaign workflows.
